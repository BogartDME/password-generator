THe application uses prompts and alerts that the user interacts with to create the settings for their password. First the user chooses their desired password length. The user then follows a series of alerts to choose the charaters making up the password- uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters.

Once the input criteria is met the application will randonly generate a password and display it on the page.
